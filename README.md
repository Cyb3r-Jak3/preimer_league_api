An **unofficial** api client for pulling player and fixture data from the [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/)

It would seem that the API backend is suited to support more leagues as well as manager so there could be future work to expand there.

There are a ton of stats that you can get for players. Read the [documentation](https://premier-league.docs.jwhite.network/en/latest/) to get started


### Goals

* Other leagues
* Use as a library rather than client
* Manager stats

# CONTRIBUTING

## How to contribute

---

Thanks for reading this because I am always looking to collaborate with other people to see their ideas.

To get started fork the repo and make a branch with an accurate name for the changes you are making. Once you have made the changes to your liking open a pull request, and I will look it over.

## Documentation

---

All functions, class, etc should be documented in a way that allows for people with an understanding of python to get how the information flows through the bot.

This project uses [restructuredText docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/) style guide.


## Testing

---

Currently, the tests at [tests](/tests) cover all the necessary items to make sure this project functions. If you add a new feature then please write a test for it as well.
